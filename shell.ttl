If the reference is part of a magazine or journal, the Publication element should be used to identify the name of the publisher. The optional Publication_Year, Publication_Month, Publication_Day, and Publisher elements should be used to more specifically identify the publication via its date and publisher. The year must follow the YYYY format while the month must follow the --MM format and the day must follow the ----DD format. The URL and URL_Date elements are used to capture a URL for the material being referenced, if one exists, and the date when the URL was validated to exist.
The required Reference_ID attribute exists to provide a globally unique identifier for the reference (e.g., REF-1). The ID is used by other entities to link to this external reference.

                                    ) ;
                rdfs:comment """An attack pattern is an abstraction mechanism for helping describe how an attack is executed. Each pattern defines a challenge that an attacker may face, provides a description of the common technique(s) used to meet the challenge, and presents recommended methods for mitigating an actual attack. Attack patterns help categorize attacks in a meaningful way in an effort to provide a coherent way of teaching designers and developers how their systems may be attacked and how they can effectively defend them.
The required Description element represents a high level description of the attack pattern. The description should be no longer than a few sentences and should include how malicious input is initially supplied, the weakness being exploited, and the resulting negative technical impact. A full step by step description does not belong as part of the description, but rather in the optional Execution_Flow element. The optional Extended_Description element provides a place for additional details important to this attack pattern, but that are not necessary to convey the fundamental concept behind the attack pattern. The optional Typical_Severity element is used to capture an overall average severity value for attacks that leverage this attack pattern with the understanding that it will not be completely accurate for all attacks. The optional Likelihood_Of_Attack element is used to capture an average likelihood that an attack that leverages this attack pattern will succeed with the understanding that it will not be completely accurate for all attacks. A number of other optional elements are available, each of which is described in more detail within the corresponding complexType that it references.
The required ID attribute provides a unique identifier for the attack pattern. It is considered static for the lifetime of the entry. If this entry becomes deprecated, the identifier should not be reused and a placeholder for the deprecated attack pattern should be left in the catalog. The required Name attribute provides a descriptive title used to give the reader an idea of what the attack pattern represents. All words in the name should be capitalized except for articles and prepositions unless they begin or end the name. The required Abstraction attribute defines the abstraction level for this attack pattern. The required Status attribute defines the status level for this view. Please refer to the related simple types for a more detailed description of what information these attributes provide and a list of valid values and their meanings.
The AbstractionEnumeration simple type defines the different abstraction levels that apply to an attack pattern. A Meta level attack pattern in CAPEC is a decidedly abstract characterization of a specific methodology or technique used in an attack. A Meta attack pattern is often void of a specific technology or implementation and is meant to provide an understanding of a high level approach. A Meta level attack pattern is a generalization of related group of standard level attack patterns. Meta level attack patterns are particularly useful for architecture and design level threat modeling exercises.
A Standard level attack pattern in CAPEC is focused on a specific methodology or technique used in an attack. It is often seen as a singular piece of a fully executed attack. A Standard attack pattern is meant to provide sufficient details to understand the specific technique and how it attempts to accomplish a desired goal. A Standard level attack pattern is a specific type of a more abstract meta level attack pattern.
A Detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow. Detailed attack patterns are more specific than meta and standard attack patterns and often require a specific protection mechanism to mitigate actual attacks. A Detailed level attack pattern often will leverage a number of different standard level attack patterns chained together to accomplish a goal."""@en .

:Category rdf:type owl:Class ;
          rdfs:comment """A category in CAPEC is a collection of attack patterns based on some common characteristic. More specifically, it is an aggregation of attack patterns based on effect/intent. (as opposed to actions or mechanisms, such an aggregation would be a meta attack pattern) An aggregation based on effect/intent is not an actionable attack and as such is not a pattern of attack behavior. Rather, it is a grouping of patterns based on some common criteria.
The required Summary element should be short and limited to the key points that define the category. The optional Relationships element is used to define relationships with attack patterns, categories, and views. The optional Taxonomy_Mappings element is used to relate this category to similar categories in taxomomies outside of CAPEC. The optional References element is used to provide further reading and insight into this category. This should be used when the category is based on external sources or projects. The optional Notes element is used to provide any additional comments that cannot be captured using the other elements of the category. The optional Content_History element is used to keep track of the original author of the category and any subsequent modifications to the content. This provides a means of contacting the authors and modifiers for clarifying ambiguities, merging overlapping contributions, etc.
The required ID attribute provides a unique identifier for the category. It is meant to be static for the lifetime of the category. In the event that the category becomes deprecated, the identifier should not be reused and a placeholder for the deprecated category should be left in the catalog. The required Name attribute provides a descriptive title used to give the reader an idea of what characteristic this category represents. All words in the name should be capitalized except for articles and prepositions unless they begin or end the name. The required Status attribute defines the status level for this category.

      rdfs:comment """A view in CAPEC represents a perspective with which one might look at the collection of attack patterns defined within CAPEC. There are three different types of views as defined by the Type attribute: graphs, explicit slices, and implicit slices.
The required Objective element describes the perspective from which the view has been constructed. The optional Audience element provides a reference to the target stakeholders or groups for whom the view is most relevant. The members of a view are either defined externally through memberOf relationships (in the case of a graph or an explict slice, see the relationships elements of categories) or by the optional Filter element (in the case of an implict slice). The Filter element holds an XSL query for identifying which attack patterns are members of an implicit slice. The optional References element is used to provide further reading and insight into this view. This should be used when the view is based on external sources or projects. The optional Notes element is used to provide any additional comments that cannot be captured using the other elements of the view. The optional Content_History element is used to keep track of the original author of the view and any subsequent modifications to the content.

The ViewTypeEnumeration simple type defines the different types of views that can be found within CAPEC. A graph is a hierarchical representation of attack patterns based on a specific vantage point that a user my take. The hierarchy often starts with a category, followed by a meta/standard attack pattern, and ends with a detailed attack pattern. An explicit slice is a subset of attack patterns that are related through some external factor. For example, a view may be used to represent mappings to external groupings like a Top-N list. An implicit slice is a subset of attack patterns that are related through a specific attribute. For example, a slice may refer to all attack patterns in draft status, or all existing meta attack patterns."""@en .

:Consequence rdfs:comment """The ConsequencesType complex type is used to specify individual consequences associated with an attack pattern. The required Scope element identifies the security property that is violated. The optional Impact element describes the technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in their attack. The optional Likelihood element identifies how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen relative to the other consequences. For example, there may be high likelihood that a pattern will be used to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be used to achieve a different impact. The optional Note element provides additional commentary about a consequence.
The optional Consequence_ID attribute is used by the internal CAPEC team to uniquely identify consequences that are repeated across any number of individual patterns. To help make sure that the details of these common consequences stay synchronized, the Consequence_ID is used to quickly identify those examples across CAPEC that should be identical. The identifier is a string and should match the following format: CC-1."""@en .
